## Style Guidelines:

- Use a 'CMYK' inspired palette: Cyan (#00AEEF), Magenta (#EC008C), Yellow (#FFF200), and Black (#000000).
- Body and headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for a clean and contemporary look that complements the bold color scheme.
- Use bold, blocky sections with high contrast for a classic Pop Art feel. Implement a grid-based layout for a structured look. The website should be highly responsive.
- Employ simple, geometric icons in bright, solid colors, drawing inspiration from Pop Art motifs (e.g., speech bubbles, stars, and graphic patterns).
- Incorporate subtle animations or transitions for visual interest when navigating between pages.
